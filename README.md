Text editor in which one can code in the terminal I made as an alternative to the `micro` text editor (https://github.com/zyedidia/micro). I made it because I wanted to edit `.html` files in it, but the Javascript code incorporated into the `.html` file itself was not treated as seperate by the current release of `micro`. It is compatible with the JIT `pypy` which can be used for faster loading speeds.
